# My React Learning Journey ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my React learning journey. I've been making great strides in understanding JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. Below are some of the projects I've worked on so far:

### 1. Background Changer
- Changes background color on button click.
- Utilizes React's `useState` and Tailwind CSS.

### 2. Password Generator
- Generates passwords of length 8-25 characters.
- Includes options for numbers and special characters.
- Implements hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, and Tailwind CSS.

### 3. Currency Converter
- Converts currency from any country to the desired one.
- Allows swapping of currency inputs.
- Involves hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useId`, custom hooks, Fetch API, props, reusable components, and Tailwind CSS.

### 4. Landing Website
- Multi-page React site with a menu.
- Utilizes React Router for navigation.
- Fetches data about my GitHub profile using Fetch API.
- Implements Router, Router-dom functions, hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useLoaderData`, `useParams`, and Tailwind CSS.

### 5. Theme Switcher
- Toggles between light and dark modes.
- Uses Context, `useContext`, `createContext`, hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and Tailwind CSS.

### 6. Todo List
- Allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
- Uses Context, `useContext`, `createContext`, hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, local storage, and Tailwind CSS.

### 7. Todo List (using Redux)
- Similar to the previous Todo List but implemented with Redux.
- Incorporates Redux features: `createStore`, `configureStore`, slices, hooks like `useDispatch`, `useSelector`, and Tailwind CSS.

### 8. Final Project - Blog Platform ðŸš€
Leveraging skills from previous projects, I'm working on an integrated blog platform. Utilizing React, Tailwind CSS, and Appwrite for backend services. Features include user authentication, post creation, editing, and deletion.



These projects might be basic, but each one has been a stepping stone in my learning journey. I've gained valuable insights into JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to venture into more advanced and complex projects, and I'm even planning to explore the backend soon.

Feel free to explore the projects, and let's grow together! ðŸŒ±
