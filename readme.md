hi guys, see my progress on learning react  
till now i have made projects as:
1. Backgroung changer:
    which changes background colour as user click on that colour button
   (using useState, tailwind CSS in react)
   
2. Password Generator:
   generates password from length 8 - 25, also takes in Numbers, special characters when user check the checkbox
   (using hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallBack, useRef, Password generating logic and Tailwind CSS in react)
   
3. Currency Convertor:
   user can convert currency of any country to the one they want, also one can swap currency inputs
   (using hooks like useState, useEffect, useId, custom hooks, FetchAPI, Props, Reuseable Components, Currency converting logic with help of fetching data from API, swap logic and Tailwind CSS in react)

4. Landing Website:
   website with menu where user can redirect to about page , contact page or Github page where data about my github profile is fetched using FetchAPI, But mainly react is single page site which is made in multi page using router, Mainly pages path are added via routerProvider and route components in parent-child element tree, more components like Header, Footer, Home, About, Contact, Github, User are made which uses router and outlet with Layout component to render themselves, also made user component which helps in take value from url
   (using Router, Router-dom and thier functions like RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter, createRoutesFromElements, Outlet, Link, NavLink, etc Hooks like useState, useEffect, useLoaderData, useParams, etc and tailwind CSS for designing)

5. Theme Switcher:
   Card and a Button- which toggles and make card LightMode to darkMode and vise-versa (same functionality provided in many sites such as tailwind site)
   (using Context -  useContext, createContext Hooks like useState, useEffect, logic for toggle between light and dark mode from checkbox)

6. Todo List:
   where user can make their todo List from Input field and add with button, also see those todos, Can Edit them or delete them, checkbox to see task is completed - Todos doesn't disappear as are saved in    localstorage
   (using Context -  useContext, createContext Hooks like useState, useEffect, LocalStorage for storing values of Todos, completed, edit, add and delete todo logic and tailwind CSS in react)

7. Todo List (using redux):
   where user can make their todo List from Input field and add with button, also see those todos, Can Edit them or delete them
   (using Redux -  create Store (configureStore), Slice (createSlice, nanoid) Hooks like useState, useEffect, useDispatch, useSelector, edit, add and delete todo logic and tailwind CSS in react)
   
I know these projects are all basics but i am learning a great deal of Javascript, React and tailwind CSS from these projects. Also, i am getting knowleadge about how these things work behind the hood little by little. I hope, soon i will make more advance and complex projects with my growth on these technologies and also add backend (Because i plan to learn backend as well)
