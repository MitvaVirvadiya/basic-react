hi guys, see my progress on learning react  
till now i have made projects as:
1. Backgroung changer - which changes background colour as user click on that colour button
   (using useState, tailwind CSS in react)
   
2. Password Generator - generates password from length 8 - 25, also takes in Numbers, special characters when user check the checkbox
   (using hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallBack, useRef, Password generating logic and Tailwind CSS in react)
   
3. Currency Convertor - user can convert currency of any country to the one they want, also one can swap currency inputs
   (using hooks like useState, useEffect, useId, custom hooks, FetchAPI, Reuseable Components, Currency converting logic with help of fetching data from API, swap logic and Tailwind CSS in react)
   
I know these projects are all basics but i am learning a great deal of Javascript, React and tailwind CSS from these projects. Also, i am getting knowleadge about how these things work behind the hood little by little. I hope, soon i will make more advance and complex projects with my growth on these technologies and also add backend (Because i plan to learn backend as well)
